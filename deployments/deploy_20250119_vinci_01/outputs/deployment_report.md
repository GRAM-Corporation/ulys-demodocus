## 1. Executive Summary

The deployment team is managing power constraints with their Starlink connection showing an 11% battery drop within an hour, providing approximately 8 more hours of operation. Equipment storage limitations are also affecting recording capabilities, with only 45 minutes of recording time available on current devices.

## 2. Key Events

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 11.5s | Chu reports 11% Starlink battery drop within the past hour |
| 19.9s | Team calculates approximately 8 hours of remaining power |
| 27.5s | Speaker 0 identifies need for Starlink connection to access Jetson device |
| 31.2s | Decision made to preserve power by shutting down Starlink temporarily |
| 35.2s | Speaker 1 provides instruction on proper power-off procedure using buttons |
| 42.1s | Storage limitation discovered - only 45 minutes of recording capacity remaining |

---

## 3. Action Items

- [ ] Power down Starlink immediately to conserve battery for critical operations
- [ ] Prepare for Jetson connection when needed (coordinate timing)
- [ ] Address storage limitations for recording equipment
- [ ] Implement proper power management procedures using designated buttons
- [ ] Monitor remaining battery levels more frequently

## 4. Technical Observations

| Component | Status/Notes |
|-----------|--------------|
| Power consumption rate | 11% battery drain per hour on Starlink system |
| Equipment involved | Starlink communication system, Jetson computing device, recording equipment |
| Storage constraint | Recording limited to 45 minutes due to storage capacity, not battery life |
| Power management | Manual controls available via buttons rather than physical disconnection |

---

## 5. Recommendations

1. Establish regular battery monitoring intervals (every 30 minutes)
2. Create power management protocol prioritizing critical system connections
3. Investigate additional storage solutions or data offloading capabilities
4. Document proper equipment shutdown procedures for team training
5. Consider backup power solutions for extended deployments
6. Implement storage management strategy to maximize recording time during critical operations

### Notable Utterances

> "Chu has reported that, yeah, within the last hour or so of us being here, eleven percent has dropped from Starlink."
> — Speaker 1 @ 11.5s

> "So that gives us eight more hours, roughly. Um, should we- do we need Starlink right now, right now?"
> — Speaker 1 @ 19.9s

> "Also, just for future, you can just click these buttons here to cut off the power. You don't have to unplug it."
> — Speaker 1 @ 35.2s
